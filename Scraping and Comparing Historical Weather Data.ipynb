    "My wife wasn't really happy, though. She replied, that she doesn't know where the statistics come from and what period this is. In fact I realized that I broke [one of the basics](https://medium.com/data-goodie/data-scientists-exercise-with-their-own-ideas-on-real-datasets-basics-for-starting-out-with-them-c7d4dad98f4b) when starting out with any statistic or data: Expressiveness. I was not sure which period of time those graphs covered and it's not stated there either. I just said some years... But was it the same amount of time? And who cares about 150 year old data anyway? Also 200 years ago part of Western Europe experienced a minor Ice Age (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age), is that taken in the account of Berlin too :D ? So I decided to make my own statistics for some relevant period of time. Firstly, I would take the data from the last 25 years to show the hypothesis' general fallacy. And secondly, examine closely the periods when Mrs. Steinmetz lived in Moscow and when she moved to Berlin to check if there might be some evidence for a little bias.\n",

    "<i>A little side note on legal stuff: when I familiarized myself with web\n",
    "scraping (here: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/), I stumbled over the fact that actually I could theoretically just use the API without scraping anything, but 'luckily' www.wetteronline.de doesn't have an API for historical data :)Funny enough, the dataquest tutorial also uses a weather page for scraping. Another important point here: dataquest uses CURRENT weather data to scrape. This could be problematic with www.wetteronline.de's current/forecasting weather data because they sell this weather data API, so this could be subject to copyright. So keep in mind to stay in conformity with the law especially if you go public with your results (a little intro: http://blog.icreon.us/advise/web-scraping-legality) </i>"
